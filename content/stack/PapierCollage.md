# You've found my collage collection! 

Lately I have been making story pages that double as iSpy-style scavenger hunts... maybe one day we'll see the story part come together üè° This format is my favorite, though, because it lets me sample from endless sources and gives me an excuse to hang onto random bits. 

Notable sources and references for the collage collection: 

* 1920s-1990s cookbooks, predominantly from Better Homes and Gardens and Time Life 
* 1990s home gardening books
* 2000-2009 graphic design books and magazines, including Extreme Design (2001) by J√ºtka Salavetz and Spencer Drate
* The Smithsonian illustrated library of antiques (a collection of 12 books), published 1979
* 1990s volumes of Communications Arts, a "print publication showcasing exceptional design"
