# PapierCollages are made using magazines, fliers, packaging, and stickers.

Recreating the feel of stories like The Borrowers, The Doll People, Spiderwick Chronicles, and with so many hidden objects, these collages are meant to be fun to look at.

Notable sources and references for the collage collection:

* 1920s-1990s cookbooks, predominantly from Better Homes and Gardens and Time Life
* 1990s home gardening books
* 2000-2009 graphic design books and magazines, including Extreme Design (2001) by Jütka Salavetz and Spencer Drate
* The Smithsonian illustrated library of antiques (a collection of 12 books), published 1979
