      I fear this blog reveals that I think ridiculous things are art. And that
      I am too genuinely interested in things that are childish. And the
      combination of that with mature content and themes might be just as
      uncomfortable to a viewer as it is to me lol. But this site is a proper
      dump blog for anything that remotely qualifies as art and as made by me,
      as we at one point thought the internet should be. Around 2017 I genuinely
      thought my internet avi had control over my life and that I'd die if my
      Twitter got deleted, fully y2k style. I'm not particularly scared of that
      anymore, though, so I'm feeding her lots of photos and art so that she
      grows big and strong.
