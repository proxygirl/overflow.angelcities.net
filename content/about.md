      Around 2017 I genuinely thought my internet avi had control over my life
      and that I'd die if my Twitter got deleted, fully y2k style. I'm not
      particularly scared of that anymore, though, so I'm feeding her lots of
      photos and art so that she grows big and strong.\

      I'm almost 30 now but I'm still learning how to do everything... This site
      holds lots of unfinished projects and half-ideas. But it's all just
      practice!
