Pappys walking power the world turning 

Google 90s rap theory and train schedules

Who is the grim reaper 

Air as rain

Errands to the lake for rocks

Trapping an itch 

Nighttime travelers

Gotta get over the dread of having to make friends... Gotta cut it with some fun activities or something

Enchanted items \
Like nothing matters until you enchant it but you can't enchant thin air \
But the items don't matter either \
Except they do because they once held enchantments which meant they were the enchantment \
Hm

Thinking about the light of the world

Want to run around want to throw up want to cry\
Also laying in a field feeling the crushing weight of it all would do

Tfw you drop your vape at the lake and it starts sliding down rocks

Feeling like I'm on some delusion type shit\
("type shit" lmao)
