Squeaky rails


Lewis and Clark rail cruise 


Thinking about how easily I could stab someone with a knitting needle if they tried to fuck with me, especially given I accidentally stabbed my own hand so easily.

Sunset on the train, everyone peacefully enjoying the view, two old men next to me sharing information about what we are passing,.. then a small voice rings out, very softly, "skibidi toilet"

Trains are not entirely different from planes, though. A trip on a train can still be quite uncomfortable at times-- the unease of a seat assignment and being caught asking your seatmate to stand every time you must use the bathroom, which is silly because there is enough leg room on some trains (and this train in particular) that if the tray table were raised or if we were comfortable enough with each other that I might raise the woman's tray table for her for a moment, also carefully lifting and replacing her bowl of cherries for her, because we are walking the line of sharing space. Sleep is still difficult (and it occurs to me now that this is, annoyingly, something the rich and occasional middle class have solved with the luxury of beds) however on a train the change in ones needs becomes apparent more slowly. Sleep isn't needed in one large 8 hour lump, necessarily, because there won't be much to do during the day and there will be plenty of time for napping. In fact, different and possibly more favorable sleeping spots will be open at different times of the day and night, so sleeping less deeply but more often is not uncomfortable. There is coffee which does not taste of the bizarre altitude or water, and fridges and ovens and taps that function without the need for complex engineering, there is a level of familiarity in the small things. At times the cars move faster than you do, even, as the train is subjected to speed controls by the cargo and bulk carrier lines. Humans do, on some level, require a basic level of routine, though. And travel is always travel, I fear. 


While things are visually simplified on the airplane, smooth white plastic surfaces, two aisles, access to  one set of bathrooms and one seat. Headphones, blanket, pillow, stay put as much as you can. Things on the train are unnecessarily complicated (or perhaps only by comparison)-- you enter a two-story, 8-car train. The bathrooms are downstairs along with the luggage, but only accessible from the coach car and only by a single stairwell. There are, however, five bathrooms and each has its own adjacent changing room and bench complete with coat hooks and a full length mirror. None of this is fancy, however, and it smells a bit slightly and is all metal and gray plastic with tags scratched into the corners of the mirrors, but it is nonetheless clean and well stocked. There are two additional cars for recreational use, almost painfully reminiscent of the era of decadent rail travel-- an observatory, or "lounge", and a dinner car. And in the observatory, there is a small spiral staircase which everyone seems to miss, and that takes you downstairs into another small dining car where you can find a woman working a kiosk booth selling snacks and sandwiches and coffees.

Airport: 

From Rituals of Transparency: "Picturing others and everything which brings you closer to them is futile from the instant that "communication" can make their presence immediate" 

From Blind Spot: "The first time our ancestors climbed a tall cliff, they experienced vertigo. Only hundreds of thousands of years later did we experience jet lag, which is to chronological displacement as vertigo is to spatial displacement. Finally, we had figured out how to move across time faster than time moves across us. In epiphany, you are neither here nor there. In jet lag, you're in duple meter, both here and there at the same time."




It is impossible to keep track of the time. You tell yourself your body remembers the most recent place you had been (not counting an airport), the fluorescent indoor lights remind you time has been abandoned, and the sky through the windows tell you what time it is where you are, for what it's worth. My clock app shows all of the relevant time zones I'd added but is at best entertaining and at worst demoralizing. In the plane they dim the lights to encourage you to sleep because it has been decided nighttime, and five hours later they raise them and bring around breakfast. When you arrive at your destination it's two hours until dinner. You're tired but you've done nothing but sit for hours. There is no way to expend any energy and the price to energize yourself is inflated tenfold. Coffee feels appropriate because it is a bit less real than the benefits of nutrition or sleep. Complementary wine on the plane is a desperate attempt at sleep during the simulated nighttime. It feels like you're meant to stand in place and wait patiently until what must be done to transport you to your destination is complete. Except in reality you rush from one terminal to the next coming off a delay and with nothing but a 30 minute layover. Hurry up and wait. You are responsible for yourself but you rely on science beyond your comprehension and timetables and controls you have never seen. You have to get yourself there and present yourself so they can do what they must to transport you.  

Hurry up and wait
