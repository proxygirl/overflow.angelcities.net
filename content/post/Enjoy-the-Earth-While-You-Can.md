more pics from the Southwest Chief (Amtrak) and other assorted public transportation from Northern California to Kansas. I would recommend nothing more highly than a long trip on the train-- to anyone. Especially if you are ever lonely! And other assorted pictures from this summer so far. Still a bit left to go, but so far it's been an unpleasant period of growth that I am not much enjoying on the whole. But these pics show off very pretty days that we can't forget about :)
