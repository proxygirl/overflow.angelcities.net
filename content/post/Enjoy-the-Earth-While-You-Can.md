more pics from the Southwest Chief (Amtrak) and other assorted public transportation from Northern California to Kansas. I would recommend nothing more highly than a long trip on the train-- to anyone. Especially if you are ever lonely! It is beautiful outside and it won't be forever and the train will sit you right up against a window to see it all with nothing else to do for literal days on end. Meet new people. Appreciate the views!
