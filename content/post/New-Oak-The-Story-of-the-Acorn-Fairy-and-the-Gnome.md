Under a centuries old oak tree, on a day that was just sunny enough to be warm, a little gnome was having a forest nap. His wagon parked beside him was full of treasures-- seeds from a water lily, the soft feather of a young owlet, and a thread of silk from a spider friend that had some to spare. He was dozing peacefully off after his long morning walk around the wood, when...

Out of the sky fell a heavy acorn -thunk!- right in the middle of his chest. He woke from his gentle rest suddenly with a gasp -ah!- And then he groaned, -owww- What a heavy thing to fall from a tree, and onto such a little gnome! But to be honest, he thought to himself, these are the kinds of things you have to be prepared for if you take a nap under an oak.

The little gnome turned his head to the side to see the giant acorn that had bounced off his chest and rolled to a stop beside him. It really was exceptionally large. And beautifully smooth with a prickly cap firmly secured atop it.

The little gnome got to his feet and, looking at the acorn determinately, began to roll it over to his wagon. He pushed aside the seeds, the feather, and the thread of silk, and, bending at the knees, gave a hearty -heave, ho!- And pushed the acorn up over the edge and into the cart -thunk- Then, proudly, he brushed his hands on his pants and reset his red cap.

Once the little gnome arrived home-- a cozy den nestled under the roots of a tree, with only the chimney, door, and a small window visible from above ground, he was properly tuckered from pulling his fully laden wagon. But there was still a bit of work to be done, and so he heaved his acorn out of the cart and rolled it into his den through the front door (which was just barely wide enough, whew!)

Finally indoors, the little gnome began taking off his sturdy boots and unwinding his long striped scarf. But he kept his thick jumper and socks for under the shade of the tree roots, it was just barely warm. He thought to himself, hm, maybe if I feel this slight chill, then the acorn does too. But it has no jumper or socks! And so he fetched a felt blanket and draped it around the acorn and stoked a fire and sat down beside it. And it was in this way, that after awhile, the tired little gnome fell asleep.

And then, in the dim light, just as the fire was beginning to put itself out, a crackling sound woke the little gnome from his rest - ckk, skk, ckkt -

The little gnome opened his eyes (but not more than a squint because he as still very sleepy), and he reached for his glasses, and once he could finally see properly he noticed, the shape of the acorn before the fire was moving and changing! His eyes opened wide and properly then.

And -thunk!-

A piece of acorn fell to the ground and the gnome's eyes opened even wider still to see, a fairy emerging from the shell!

She had two disheveled braids and skin the color of honey and as she climbed out of the small hole in the acorn the pleasant light odor of cooked chestnuts wafted into the room.

Somewhat flustered, the little gnome watched as the fairy slipped on his own large slippers and wrapped herself in the felt blanket and plopped herself back down in front of the fire with a soft sigh -ahh-

The little gnome wiped his sweating palms on his pants and shuffled anxiously to the kitchen where he unwrapped a big piece of cornbread and plated it with butter and honey.

(He did this partly because he didn't know what else to do in the fairy's presence and sought to make himself useful, and he figured she must be hungry.)

Back before the fire he offered it to his delicate guest, who reached a hand out from under the blanket to accept the plate.

"What's this?" she asked, with a voice that sounded like the ringing of bells.

"Cornbread" the gnome replied, still somewhat flustered but managing a matter-of-fact answer nonetheless.

"Ooo I've never tried this before", the fairy said.

Then, she took a huge bite and honey ran down her chin. Her eyes widened and she let out a squeak of surprise.

With her mouth still full she exclaimed-- "This is my new favorite cake!"

She chewed and swallowed, and then took another mouthful, bits of cornbread crumbling off as she did and falling to the ground. She swallowed again, and then popped the last of the cake into her mouth. Looking over to her new gnome friend as she picked up bits of cornmeal from the blanket and stuffed them, too, into her mouth, she asked

"Do you by chance have some warm milk with honey, too?"

That night, the gnome gave the fairy his bed stuffed with autumn leaves and took the chair beside the fire. He had also given the fairy the felt blanket, or rather, she had yet to take it off her shoulders, and so he himself slept under a small throw that barely reached to his knees. But nevertheless, his heart was full because his new friend, although a bit odd, was amusing and made him feel warm for the pleasant company.

And that is the story of how the little gnome met the acorn fairy. And they would have many adventures together, which I will recount for you all in due time.
