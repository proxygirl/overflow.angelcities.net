this was my favorite game to play on the Nintendo DS when I was younger, and when I got a 2DS recently I wanted to play it again. I was so impressed by the art and character designâ€“ now I want to recreate the whole Layton universe at some point. Embroidering characters is a little too technical for me to do again anytime soon though.
