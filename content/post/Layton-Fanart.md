Professor Layton and the Curious Village was my favorite game to play on the Nintendo DS when I was younger, and when I got a 2DS recently I wanted to play it again. I was so impressed by the art and character design– now I want to recreate the whole Layton universe at some point. I’m not going to lie, though, embroidering characters is a little too finicky for me to do again anytime soon.
