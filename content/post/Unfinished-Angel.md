There once was an angel who was like all other angels in that once she came of age she would experience a fall. Except this was all she could say when it came to the similarities between herself and others. Other angels hid their slow loss of footing and accelerating slide down the loose rocks into hell. This was just how it happened, it was an inexplicable part of the process. And this very thing had been happening for centuries, in this specific way at least since angels were afforded the extended comforts of heaven until adolescence rather than their gravity failing immediately upon their appearance no longer resembling fat babies. 

This angel longed for a friend to talk to about what was happening. 

Since heaven and hell and humanity exist all now on the same physical plane, there were humans to talk to in addition to the angels. And other angels masquerading as humans in desperate attempts to prolong their fates. There were all lovely people to talk to and great companions could be made from them but it was a tricky business. 

And every time our angel thought she was standing still while shooting the breeze with others she would look down to realize she was a full inch further down the slope. 

It was worth it, though, because she did not know how to make sense of what was happening and sometimes she would meet others who had slid or were sliding too and those encounters made the angel feel a bit less afraid. Because those people were okay. And didn't seem to mind sharing a bit about how it happened and how it felt. 

And sometimes there were witty humans, or the angels masquerading as humans, who shared tips for how to scamper back up a few rocks or improve ones mental orientation toward hell. 

One day, after many months of fearful sliding, the angel realized something, though-- that she was no longer moving. She certainly felt like she was, the sky was drifting by and she could feel the drop itself in her stomach and she felt very unsteady. But there were no rocks beneath her feet, only flat and hard packed dirt. She felt as though she were strapped to the front of a train, but everything was silent. No echoing lose pebbles or rustling gravel. Even the wind she felt had no sound. She felt like she needed to open her mouth to scream or sprint to throw herself off the cliff she knew she stood on the edge of but at that exact moment she also knew there was no point in doing anything besides stay right where she was. She had stopped falling at some point and now that she had seen it there was no point in petulent protest. 


She waited. 

She sat down.

She took a deep breath. 


And for a second she thought everything stopped moving. 

But then it started up again.

She felt the rush of vertigo like she had been yanked back at the end of a bungee jump. If only she could actually feel that. It felt like she imagined that might feel, let's say. 




The angel sat for quite a bit longer. Staring at her feet waiting for a confirmation of what was going on.




Then, after a bit of time had passed, the angel realized that in reality nothing had changed. She still felt as though she was falling in the exact way she did when she had actually been falling. And she still wished she had someone to talk to, perhaps now more than ever. She didn't know how long she had been falling and slipping and sliding in reality, but now her interactions with the humans and the angels masquerading as humans and those suffering out their punishments in hell would be the same as before because she felt the same. Her best hope would be that their witty phrases and pet rocks would somehow hold new meaning to her now that she knew the truth. Perhaps those pet rocks were always meant for someone who knew they were not actually falling to hold them. 




And perhaps one day she would learn why she felt like she was falling although she was on solid ground. Perhaps there was some deeper acceptance of her fate she would come to learn, and that would stabilize her immediate environment. 




All of those things were true, in the end. However, not in the way our angel had expected. 




In reality, the angel had forgotten to consider one important thing that would prevent her from seeing her fate-- where she had landed. 




Our poor angel was, regrettably, in hell.




Around her angels freshly grown out of their adolescence stumbled around, nude. They practically poured out from the hillside in a crush. Beside the hill was a dusty field where the angels disentangled themselves, and beyond that, a field of aphosels were just beginning to bloom and their thick stalks cracked as they were clumsily thrust aside. They cried out, all of them. Our angel remembers no sound at all from her own fall and stumble, though, and exposing her to that now would certainly bring tears to her eyes. 




Each sin, they will come to learn, is punished in real time-- an eternity of suffering in the manner befitting. Just as the lustful are forever caught in the winds for Dante are they here, but it is called by other names. The psychological toll of being unable to experience love from one who wishes to give it, the forced restraint when faced with literal death, the shame of a bad habit, empathy for someone who has hurt you, silence in self sabotage.




But, of course, God has died. And upon arriving on this cursed plane everyone will receive a small piece of him. It is the only outside resource that will be given for certain, although whether it is of benefit is pointless to even consider. It has been stuck inside of you. And that piece of god, it has been said, grants powers and perceptions.





The instincts of a curse versus the so called dignity gained by human reasoning
